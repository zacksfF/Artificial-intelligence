# Another time
I want to keep this repo For parctice the my favort stack
- **Go** and Pytorch(and his ecosystems)
- The most issue in the field of AI is Production
- **Go** solve that to make easy and understanding what you do on you software
- Powerfull battries i mean strong std libraries
- powerfull for deployment
- and why Pythorch, well I practice and i learn a lot of deep learning framework such as tensorflow, mxnet, jax, keras, paddle-paddle
- so Pytorch is most wedly used for research and researcher is a key for production(engineers)
- have active ecosystems and powerfull document
- support all architecture for deep learning and so on.
- I don't like to talk to much lets working ......
